# Terms and components

## Input
An input is a JSON declaration for formulaik to show a component referenced by a the `component` key.

### Illustration 
```js
const inputs = [
{
      component: 'input',
      id: 'email',
      label: 'Email',
      type: "string",
      params: {        
        placeholder: "email@domain.com"
      },
      validations: [
        {
          kind: "format",
          value: "email",
          message: 'Invalid email format',
        },
        {
          kind: "required",
          value: true,
          message: "This field can't be blank",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      component: 'inputPassword',
      label: 'Password',
      id: 'password',
      type: "string",
      params: {
        autoComplete: "current-password",
        placeholder: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
      },
      validations: [
        {
          kind: "required",
          value: true,
          message: "This field can't be blank",
        },
        {
          kind: "matches",
          value: /^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{8,}$/,
          message: 'Invalid password, must contain at least 8 characters and at most 18 characters',
        },
      ]
    },
    {
        component: 'checkbox',        
        id: 'rememberMe',
        type: "boolean",
        params: {
            label: 'Remember me',
        }
    },
    {
      component: 'submit',
      id: 'submit',
      params: {
        text: 'Continue'
      }
    },
]
```

* The input with the `id` "email" tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `email` id
    - to label the `component` *Email*
    - to expect a `string` data type 
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *placeholder* customization
    - to use the `validations` rules:
      - `format`: make sure it's an email
      - `required`: this field is required

* The input with the `id` *password* tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `password` id
    - to label the `component` *Password*
    - to expect a `string` data type 
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *placeholder* and the *autoComplete* customizations
    - to use the `validations` rules:      
      - `required`: this field is required
      - `matches`: this field matches the provided regex, if not, display the error message


* The input with the `id` *rememberMe* tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `checkbox` id    
    - to expect a `boolean` data type 
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *label* customizations

* The input with the `id` *submit* tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `submit` id        
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *text* (label) customizations
    
As you can see the inputs come as an ordered array and are fed to your Formulaik engine of choice.
They are:
- Platform agnostic
- Language agnostic

This means they can easily be store in a shared repository and shared across your teams.

## Component
A `component` is an input wrapper that adapts an actual input component to the Formulaik api.

### Illustration 
In the previous example we used a checkbox component, here is how we declare its component. 

```js
import React from 'react'
import FormControlLabel from '@mui/material/FormControlLabel'
import Checkbox from '@mui/material/Checkbox'

export default (props) => {
  const { 
    onValueChanged, 
    disabled,
    readOnly,
    value, 
    item: { 
        label, 
        id, 
        params 
        }} = props


  return <div className="">
    <FormControlLabel control={
      <Checkbox
        color="default"
        disabled={disabled}
        readOnly={readOnly}
        {...params}
        checked={value}
        onChange={({ target: { checked } }) => {
          onValueChanged(checked)
        }}
      />}
      label={params.label ? params.label : label} />
  </div>
}
```

This component adapts a Google Material UI (Mui) Switch input to Formulaik.
It is available as a free community components library on [Github](https://github.com/formulaik-community/formulaik-mui-react).
- It forwards the `disabled` and the `readOnly` states to the Mui component
- It forwards the rest of the `params` the Mui component for a pass-through customization
- It binds the current `value` the Mui component prop `checked`
- It binds the Formulaik provided `onValueChanged` to the Mui component prop `onChange`
By doing these simple bindings and forwarding, this component has now a minimal Formulaik compatibility and can be used on any Formulaik form that references a component library that includes this component.

## Component Library
A Formulaik component library is a set of Formulaik compatible inputs each with a unique key.
Usually it comes in a form of a repository folder with each component 
Formulaik's strength lies in the modularity of the components library. 
You can quickly switch from one component to the other by referring different component libraries.

### Structure
A component library is basically a function that returns a component when given a key (the `component` part of an `input`).

Nevertheless it can be advantageous to follow a common organization across the components libraries to ease debugging, improve readability and copy or paste components. 
This is the recommended structure:

```bash
├── my-component-library
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── myInputA
│   ├──── index.js
│   ├── myInputB
│   ├──── index.js
```

### Illustration 
As mentioned before, we are using the Mui components library available as a free community components library on [Github](https://github.com/formulaik-community/formulaik-mui-react).

#### First approach
One way to serve the components is to make a basic switch on the key value and return the existing component.
For instance, for our inputs, we would have:
```js
import Input from './input'
import Submit from './submit'
import Checkbox from './checkbox'
import InputPassword from './inputPassword'

export default (props) => {
  const { type } = props
  switch (type) {
    case 'input':
      return Input  
    case 'inputPassword':
      return InputPassword
    case 'submit':
      return Submit    
    case 'checkbox':
      return Checkbox    
    default:
      return null
  }
}
```
#### Optimization
An alternative is to use a lazy loading approach with tools like `@loadable` for instance:

```js
import loadable from '@loadable/component'

export default (props) => {
    const { type } = props
    if (!keys.includes(type)) {
        return null
    }
    try {
        const Component = loadable(props => import(`./${type}`), {
            cacheKey: props => type,
        })
        return Component
    } catch (e) {
        return null
    }
}

const keys = [   
    'submit',    
    'input',
    'inputPassword',        
    'checkbox'    
]
```

## Validator
A validator is a JSON representation of validation rules used by your formulaik engine.
