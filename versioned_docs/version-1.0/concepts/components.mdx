# Terms, definitions and components

## Commands
Commands folders are a direct representation of the arborescence of commands the end user will see.

## Questions
A CLI will certainly make use of inquiries to the user. We call them questions, and they are built with certain requirements in mind:
- Questions can be declared in a conventional way in the src/questions folder
- Any command can declare the questions it will use, by doing so Formulaik will automatically extract the cli parameters from those questions and inject them in the help view.
- When a question is declared in a command, it inherits the question that is declared project wide in the src/questions folder. By doing so you can simply declare a command question by giving its id.
- Any extension can declare its questions as well

### Validators
Validators are used to check user's input for a question.
- Validators can be declared separately in the src/validators folder
- They can also be declared inline in reference to a question
- Any extension can declare its validators as well

### Transformers
Transformers are used to format a value before or after a user's input. They can also be used to format the data displayed to a user without having an actual effect on the final input.
- Transformers can be declared separately in the src/validators folder
- They can also be declared inline in reference to a question
- Any extension can declare its transformers as well
