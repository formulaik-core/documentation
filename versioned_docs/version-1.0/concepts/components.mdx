# Components

### Commands
Commands folders are a direct representation of the arborescence of commands the end user will see.

### Questions
A CLI will certainly make use of inquiries to the user. We call them questions, and they are built with certain requirements in mind:
- Questions can be declared in a conventional way in the src/questions folder
- Any command can declare the questions it will use, by doing so Formulaik will automatically extract the cli parameters from those questions and inject them in the help view.
- When a question is declared in a command, it inherits the question that is declared project wide in the src/questions folder. By doing so you can simply declare a command question by giving its id.
- Any extension can declare its questions as well
