# Styling

Formulaik comes with minimal styling, the components support their own styling using the styling framework or strategy you use in your app.

## Styling input
Each input can be given a `className` value that will be applied to the `component`.

For instance, using tailwind you can adapt an email input depending on the current breakpoint:

```js
{
    component: 'input',
    id: 'email',
    label: 'Email',
    type: "string",
    className: 'w-full md:w-2/3'
}
```
