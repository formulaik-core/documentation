# Build your first form

> In this guide we will use an existing component library that adapts some of the Google Material UI components: [formulaik-mui-react](https://github.com/formulaik-community/formulaik-mui-react).

## Declare inputs
An [input](../concepts/terms#input) is a JSON declaration for formulaik to show a component referenced by a the `component` key.
This is where we define what the form will look like, which components it will include and how each one of them will behave.

```js
const inputs = [
{
      component: 'input',
      id: 'email',
      label: 'Email',
      type: "string",
      params: {        
        placeholder: "email@domain.com"
      },
      validations: [
        {
          kind: "format",
          value: "email",
          message: 'Invalid email format',
        },
        {
          kind: "required",
          value: true,
          message: "This field can't be blank",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      component: 'inputPassword',
      label: 'Password',
      id: 'password',
      type: "string",
      params: {
        autoComplete: "current-password",
        placeholder: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
      },
      validations: [
        {
          kind: "required",
          value: true,
          message: "This field can't be blank",
        },
        {
          kind: "matches",
          value: /^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{8,}$/,
          message: 'Invalid password, must contain at least 8 characters and at most 18 characters',
        },
      ]
    },
    {
        component: 'checkbox',        
        id: 'rememberMe',
        type: "boolean",
        params: {
            label: 'Remember me',
        }
    },
    {
      component: 'submit',
      id: 'submit',
      params: {
        text: 'Continue'
      }
    },
]
```

* The input with the `id` "email" tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `email` id
    - to label the `component` *Email*
    - to expect a `string` data type 
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *placeholder* customization
    - to use the `validations` rules:
      - `format`: make sure it's an email
      - `required`: this field is required

* The input with the `id` *password* tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `password` id
    - to label the `component` *Password*
    - to expect a `string` data type 
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *placeholder* and the *autoComplete* customizations
    - to use the `validations` rules:      
      - `required`: this field is required
      - `matches`: this field matches the provided regex, if not, display the error message

* The input with the `id` *rememberMe* tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `checkbox` id    
    - to expect a `boolean` data type 
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *label* customizations

* The input with the `id` *submit* tells formulaik 
    - to use the `component` with the `submit` id        
    - to forward the `params` to the component, namely the *text* (label) customizations
    
As you can see the inputs come as an ordered array and are fed to your Formulaik engine of choice.
They are:
- Platform agnostic
- Language agnostic


## Declare values
`Values` are the default values passed to Formulaik. You need to match the ids provided in the inputs section.

```js
const values = {
  email: cookies.get('email'),
  password: "",
  rememberMe: cookies.get('rememberMe'),
}
```

## Handle submission
Formulaik was built to make form submission seamless and easy.
Once all the validations have passed, the `onSubmit` callback is called with the `values` provided by the user and a few extra options:

```js
 const onSubmit = async (values) => {
    const { email, password } = values
    try { 
      await myapi.submit({ email, password })
    }
    catch(e) {
      throw (new Error('Could not sign in: ', e.message))
    }
    return { message: t("Email validated") }  
  }
```

When `onSubmit` is called a few things happen under the hood:
- The form is in the `isSubmitting` state. This means all your components are disabled, and if your `submit` component allows it, it will be in a *loading state*. You have nothing to manage here.
- When everything goes well, you can return a JSON object that contain the `message` field to notify the user the operation succeeded.
- In case of an error, simply throw the error. Formulaik will catch it and notify the user accordingly.


## Putting it all together


```js
import Formulaik from '@formulaik/react'
import FormulaikMui from '@formulaik-community/react-mui'

export default (props) => {
  
  const inputs = [
  {
    component: 'input',
    id: 'email',
    label: 'Email',
    type: "string",
    params: {        
      placeholder: "email@domain.com"
    },
    validations: [
      {
        kind: "format",
        value: "email",
        message: 'Invalid email format',
      },
      {
        kind: "required",
        value: true,
        message: "This field can't be blank",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    component: 'inputPassword',
    label: 'Password',
    id: 'password',
    type: "string",
    params: {
      autoComplete: "current-password",
      placeholder: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
    },
    validations: [
      {
        kind: "required",
        value: true,
        message: "This field can't be blank",
      },
      {
        kind: "matches",
        value: /^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{8,}$/,
        message: 'Invalid password, must contain at least 8 characters and at most 18 characters',
      },
    ]
  },
  {
      component: 'checkbox',        
      id: 'rememberMe',
      type: "boolean",
      params: {
          label: 'Remember me',
      }
  },
  {
    component: 'submit',
    id: 'submit',
    params: {
      text: 'Continue'
    }
  },]

 const onSubmit = async (values) => {
    const { email, password } = values
    try { 
      await myapi.submit({ email, password })
    }
    catch(e) {
      throw (new Error('Could not sign in: ', e.message))
    }
    return { message: t("Email validated") }  
  }

  return <>      
      <h3>Login</h3>            
      <Formulaik
        components={[FormulaikMui]}
        values={values}        
        inputs={inputs}
        onSubmit={onSubmit}
         />      
    </>
}

```

We give a few props to the `Formulaik` component:
- `components={[FormulaikMui]}`: a list of component libraries to pick the input components from
- `values={values}`:  Formulaik the default values 
- `inputs={inputs}`: the inputs list
- `onSubmit={onSubmit}`: the submission handler

Voil√†.
