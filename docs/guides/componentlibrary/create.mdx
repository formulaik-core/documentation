# Create

- An extension needs to be registered through its index.js > register method
- An extension can declare questions, validators and transformers the same way a Formulaik app does


## Create an extension

### Standalone extension project
This command creates a standalone npm module that can be imported in a Formulaik app:

```bash
formulaik extension new -h
```
The module will have this structure:
```bash
├── src
├── ├── ... (extension content)
└── package.json
```


### Inline extension
This command creates an extension content in the *extensions* folder of a Formulaik app:
```bash
formulaik extension add -h
```
