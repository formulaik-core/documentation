## Format
We recommend to make your inputs serializable unless you don't plan to host them remotely.
It's a good practice to make them as declarative as possible. In other words, treat them like JSON data that can be shared, commited, tested and audited independently.

## Special inputs
Some component ids are reserved for inputs Formulaik engines need for running properly.
