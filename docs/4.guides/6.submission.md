# Handle Submission

Submission is an essential part of any form building. 
Formulaik was built to make form submission seamless and easy.
Once all the validations have passed, the `onSubmit` callback is called with the `values` provided by the user and a few extra options:

## Illustration

```js
 const onSubmit = async (values) => {
    const { email, password } = values
    try { 
      await myapi.submit({ email, password })
    }
    catch(e) {
      throw (new Error('Could not sign in: ', e.message))
    }
    return { message: t("Email validated") }  
  }
```

When `onSubmit` is called a few things happen under the hood:
- The form is in the `isSubmitting` state. This means all your components are disabled, and if your `submit` component allows it, it will be in a *loading state*. You have nothing to manage here.
- When everything goes well, you can return a JSON object that contain the `message` field to notify the user the operation succeeded.
- In case of an error, simply throw the error. Formulaik will catch it and notify the user accordingly.

That's it!
